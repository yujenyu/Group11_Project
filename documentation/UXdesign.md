## UX Design
In this part, each of us discuss lots of ideas for our web as a group, combining variety of ideas and research to implement it. According to some users’ feedback, we modified the interface and design pattern to convenience the user. We follow the minimalist design and intuitive thinking, expect someone who use our web with enjoyable experience.

### Design Process and ideation

In the beginning, we discussed the topic and type of game, the chart below shows the initial idea of our project. Our central idea is art education, following this concept we decided to develop “Fun Facts” and “Art Detective” game. According to design thinking, user-centered design is which we follow.

The mind map below shows the game type we had at the stage.

In addition, the following mind map shows issues we may had. For example, the first step we considered is our user’s generation, it affected the design of our web and the contents. After the discussion, we decided to focus on university student and teenager. Research indicated that the average time people spent on a website just under 15 seconds, therefore we need to catch their eye at the start.

Moreover, the art history is boundless, in our web we emphasise on oil painting and the timeline of art history is from Renaissance to Abstract Expressionism. Here’s the timeline of our project.

### Early prototyping

### Identification of interacting users and broader stakeholders.

| Name          | Age          | About                                   |
| ------------  | ------------ |---------------------------------------- |
| Arthur        | 23 | A postgrad student who has lots of experience of developing web as a front end engineer. He has no idea about art, he want to know more about art history without pressure  |
| Henry         | 32 | A chip engineer who doesn’t have many experience of playing computer games. He think online game always need to pay much attention and time to play, and he prefer intuitive game instead of complex one especially in his leisure time. |
| Marina        | 18 | A undergrad student who major in art and she doesn’t like to play video games at all. If there’s a way to gain more knowledge in a easy way, she would like to give it a try. |
| Vanessa       | 25 |  A theater designer who love to play digital game after work. She prefer to play strategy games, but never tried web game. If there’s a way to learn something by playing a web game, she would love to try.|

### UX approach – design heuristics

* Visibility of system status and connect to the real world

The topic of our web is art history, our design pattern included variety of oil painting which related to artistic theme. Each of our page is surrounded by masterpiece and simple icon, helping user easier to learn and remember how the interface works. It’s clear to choose which period of art you want to know and play, separated by different iconic painting with title and time. We chose pictures instead of verbose contents, minimize the information of history, created a beginner friendly web is our ultimate objective.

* User control

On our web, we decided to make user easy to switch between each page by scrolling up to down and left to right. To provide user exit the pop up menu, there’s a “X” on the upper-left corner. However, pop up info of timeline page can be quit just by clicking out of the pop up window. We make user easy to exit and have more freedom to do their task.

* Error prevention

It’s necessary to alert user when they’re making an error, with the intention to make it easy for them to do whatever it is they are doing without making a mistake. We made some necessary sign for them to follow.

* Efficiency of use and minimalist design

Instead of use four buttons for each page in front page, we changed the idea into a menu button, it’s a shortcut for novice users. When user click it, the menu will pop up a window. It makes our first page more minimalistic. In timeline page, we chose slide style to implement each period of art.

* Help and documentation

On our web, we provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks. In the game page, there’s an introduction and guide before playing, helping user understand the rule and how to play before next step.



### Understanding of user group (questionnaires / user stories / interviews)

(TODO)



### Wireframes and interaction flow diagrams for final key subsystems.

(TODO)

* Do research

* Prepare research for reference

* Make sure user flow mapped out

* Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate

* Add some detail and get testing

* Start turning wireframes into prototypes
