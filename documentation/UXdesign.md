## UX Design
In this part, each of us discuss lots of ideas for our web as a group, combining variety of ideas and research to implement it. According to some users’ feedback, we modified the interface and design pattern to convenience the user. We follow the minimalist design and intuitive thinking, expect someone who use our web with enjoyable experience.

### Design Process and ideation

In the beginning, we discussed the topic and type of game, the chart below shows the initial idea of our project. Our central idea is art education, following this concept we decided to develop “Fun Facts” and “Art Detective” game. According to design thinking, user-centered design is which we follow.

The mind map below shows the game type we had at the stage.

In addition, the following mind map shows issues we may had. For example, the first step we considered is our user’s generation, it affected the design of our web and the contents. After the discussion, we decided to focus on university student and teenager. Research indicated that the average time people spent on a website just under 15 seconds, therefore we need to catch their eye at the start.

Moreover, the art history is boundless, in our web we emphasise on oil painting and the timeline of art history is from Renaissance to Abstract Expressionism. Here’s the timeline of our project.

### Early prototyping

## Identification of interacting users and broader stakeholders.

| Name          | Age          | About                                   |
| ------------  | ------------ |---------------------------------------- |
| Arthur        | 23 | A postgrad student who has lots of experience of developing web as a front end engineer. He has no idea about art, he want to know more about art history without pressure  |
| Henry         | 32 | A chip engineer who doesn’t have many experience of playing computer games. He think online game always need to pay much attention and time to play, and he prefer intuitive game instead of complex one especially in his leisure time. |
| Marina        | 18 | A undergrad student who major in art and she doesn’t like to play video games at all. If there’s a way to gain more knowledge in a easy way, she would like to give it a try. |
| Vanessa       | 25 |  A theater designer who love to play digital game after work. She prefer to play strategy games, but never tried web game. If there’s a way to learn something by playing a web game, she would love to try.|

## UX approach – design heuristics/approach, design methods (design fiction / heuristics)

### Design Heuristics

* Visibility of system status

* Match between system and the real world

* User control

* Consistency and standards

* Error prevention

* Recognition rather than recall

* Flexibility and efficiency of use

* Aesthetic and minimalist design

Instead of use four buttons for each page in front page, we changed the idea into a menu button,

when user click it, the menu will pop up a menu window. It makes our first page more minimalistic.

In timeline page, we chose slide style to implement each period of art.

* Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

* Help and documentation



## Understanding of user group (questionnaires / user stories / interviews)

### Questionnaires

### User stories

### Interviews





## Wireframes and interaction flow diagrams for final key subsystems.

* Do research

* Prepare research for reference

* Make sure user flow mapped out

* Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate

* Add some detail and get testing

* Start turning wireframes into prototypes
