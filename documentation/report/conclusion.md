## Conclusion

### Working Practices

Looking back at the process of the entire project, since everyone has a clearer division of labor, the efficiency of our group is fairly high.

Due to the Covid, meeting in real life is a bit difficult, so efficient communication between team members has become a tricky problem. At the beginning of the project, we only used Micosoft Teams for regular group discussions to develop a general plan for the next step, but this was far from enough. Realizing this problem, we added the issues function in GitHub to discuss the problems encountered, including the handling of some details. By this way, the discussion between our group members became efficient.

At the same time, this project can be regarded as the first time we use git as a team to work together. How to work together to handle different functions and codes is indeed a serious issue, because the group members work together on the same file at the same time could be a disaster. After discussion, we decided to divide the project into different parts according to the features. We deal with different parts separately, and then merge them. In this way, the efficiency of our work has been improved, and there is no need to worry about dealing with conflicts.

### Success of the Project
Our project achieves the aim that we want to design games that can make users learn about art history with fun. Our application also helps users to gain different levels of critical thinking through the games. Based on the feedback from our users, they were satisfied with the overall design and style of the application.

### Impact of Covid
During the pandemic, it's tough for us to cooperate with each other virtually. It has a significant effect on us due to the lack of human interaction, some issues becoming hard to discuss and spent more time to help each other remotely. Therefore, some of our teammate tried to meet up at Uni end of this term to improve work efficiency, it speeded up the whole process and save times to debug in person. In this unusual year, we’ve learned a lot to solve problems and overcome difficulties in a innovate way that made us stronger.

### Social and Ethical Implications
The aim of our web is to make user interest in art, giving them a path to entry the world of art. Due to educational resources decrease, arts subjects are being cut back in many schools, hence the fewer opportunities for people to be exposed to art. We hope user are inspired by the history of art, found that we’re surrounded by art in daily life by visiting our web. It’s not necessary to store user data on our web, therefore we have less issues in ethical implication part. 

### Future Work
* Design
In our design of web, there’re some points could be improve in the future. In the beginning, we expect this web can be more interactive with user and record the score and rank in the game, making user have more motivation to play it. Unfortunately, we haven’t implemented this part on our web. However, we’ve made the web more elegant and simplicity for user that we expected. For example, some button is clear for user to follow, e.g. menu bar or scrolling. In contrast, the game page is not that intuitive for user to go back to home page. To improve this, it’s better to have a “back” button for user freedom and control. Furthermore, we can improve the usability and playability by introducing some new features based on the final user feedback (shown in the Evaluation part).

* Development
Short term goal will be fixing the unpassed testings that are listed in the manual testing part. For the frontend development, we found that Javascript was hard to integrate into the Angular framework. It is necessary to turn Javascript into Typescript if we want to develop more advanced functions. Also, we could include more game material and design more games. As for the backend, the current architecture is sufficiently scalable to cope with future increases in the amount of data stored and the addition of new features. On the other hand, the data in the database is initialised every time it is started, so this may be a room for improvement if we intend to handle large amounts of data in the future.

* Evaluation
In this project, we only use manual testing to check the functionalities of the application except the backend API. Although the application is not very complicated, it is better to develop methods that could do the unit and integration testing in detail. In fact, we did some research on testing code under Angular framework. However, we do not have enough time to learn Typescript to make testing code. The testing part definitely can be improved in the future.
