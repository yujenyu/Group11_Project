Everyone in our group plays a role in the development:

| Name         | Role                                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Masashi Asai | Backend Developer                      |
| Lauren Chian | Frontend Developer                     |
| Chun-Yu Chen | Project Management                     |
| Yu-Jen Yu    | UI/UX Designer                         |
| Zhengwu Song | Frontend Developer and Backend Support |

We regularly hold the meetings twice a week on Microsoft Teams. We set a clear topic and came up with ideas and decisions in every meeting. You can find out the meeting minutes in this [link](https://github.com/yujenyu/Group11_Project/blob/master/Meetings/meeting.md).
We mainly use our group Github to track the development progress and do version control. We created five feature branches, whitch correspond to the five main sections of our application (front page, timeline, fun facts, art detective, and about page) and backend development. We allocated each section to different members for developing the front end.

| Main Section  | Member           |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Front Page    | Chun-Yu, Masashi |
| Timeline      | Chun-Yu, Yu-Jen  |
| Fun Facts     | Lauren           |
| Art Detective | Zhengwu          |
| About         | Chun-Yu          |

Yu-Jen did the overall UI design for the whole application. As a backend developer in our group, Masashi did the research and integrated both frontend and backend. Dev(development) is the branch that we put all the sections together to test and visulise the whole application. Finally, we will merge dev branch with main branch to release our final version. 

Although we work independently in the different parts, we always check other branches and make suggestions for others. We use the “Issues” function in our repo to track questions, bugs, invalid functions, or enhancement requests. You can easily find the specific issues by filtering the tags. Furthermore, we set several milestones to mark the significant achievement of the works. You can review our issues and milestones in this [link](https://github.com/yujenyu/Group11_Project/issues). In summary, we have created X issues and X milestones. 

We did not plan a sprint to intensively do developing together, because not all of our members are in the same timezone. However, by using the issues on GitHub, we build an efficient and clear channel to communicate. We also use HackMD to edit the note together, so every member can learn from each others by studying the note. You can find our technical note in [Notes for Group 11](https://hackmd.io/_tVdvtt7Q_GleFZ5sQNuZg?view).
