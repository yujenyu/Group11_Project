The Birth of Venus

Sandro Botticelli

1484-1486 

1. Why does not Venus wear clothes?

Because she was just born, the goddess Trois Graces next to her was about to help her dress. This is not the moment when ordinary people are born, but the birth of a goddess. According to legend, Venus was already an adult when she was born.

2. What kind of flower is the flower in the painting?

Next to Venus are roses. Because roses are symbols of love and beauty, they are usually painted around Venus. When Venus steps on the ground, roses will grow wherever she walks. Also, because it was spring, Botticelli painted cornflowers. The patterns on the goddess Trois Graces's robe is the evergreen crape myrte flowers, which symbolize eternal life.

3. Why are there almost no shadows in the painting?

In order to express Venus's beauty, which is beyond ordinary people, bright and soft colours were used throughout the painting. Her complexion reminds people of pearls, and the whole person is radiant. This painting allows people to see that her radiance has changed the world. Although the right side of the painting is darker, it looks like Venus has driven the darkness away.

4. Why do the people in the painting seem to be "attached" to the background?

This is because Botticelli deliberately emphasized the characters' outline, which makes people feel as if they can be cut along the contour. The body drawn with meticulous lines is like a prison that seals the soul. This concept comes from the Medici family's close Neo-Platonists, which were very popular in Florence in the fifteenth century. Botticelli often stayed with these philosophers and was deeply influenced by their thoughts.

David with the Head of Goliath

Caravaggio

1607

1. Who is he? Why is there a head in his hand?

He is the David in the Bible with the Goliath's head of the giant he killed. The Bible says that David resisted the giants and the people he led, not allowing them to harm his countrymen. He defeated their leader, which was equivalent to conquering all the enemies. 

He was initially just a shepherd. King Saul wanted to give him a bronze helmet and armour, but he refused, and he went straight to the battlefield in this way. His weapons were only a slingshot and five stones, while the giant wears armour and a bronze helmet and holds a bronze war and a sword. In order to describe David's courage, the painter chose to paint the last scene of this story.

2. How could David defeat the giant?

Although it seemed that Goliath was taller and more robust, this was also the reason for his failure. For shepherds who were good at using slingshots, it was easy to aim at the target. Goliath didn't pay attention to this thin boy at all, but David moved fast and had wisdom. As a result, Goliath's vast and robust body harmed himself because of his poor reaction and made David's weaknesses an advantage. 

3. Why did Caravaggio painted this picture so dark?

The dark background can set off the characters and make the theme more obvious. Caravaggio often used such backdrops, landscapes or other props to focus on several key elements. In this way, the characters in the paintings are easier to be focused on and more dramatic.

4. Why does Goliath's head seem to roll out of the painting?

David held his head and stretched it towards us. The black background contrasted with the bright shape, producing a three-dimensional visual effect. The sense of light in Caravaggio's painting is like a projector. The brilliant part became like a sculpture as if about to run out of it. This technique makes this scene more charming
and makes the viewers have a kind of illusion as if they can reach out their hands to touch the characters in the painting.


## Romanticism
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78802441/114896923-55897000-9e43-11eb-9e86-7fac9a84207d.png)

The Colossus

Francisco de Goya

1808-1812

1. Is the person in the sky a Greek god?

No. This painting is called "The Colossus", which means "giant". The Colossus is taller than a mountain and has powerful muscles. But the author did not give him a name and identity source.

2. Are the people on the ground fleeing for their lives?

Although there are many people, the distance is too far, so their movements can not be seen clearly. However, we can see that they are escaping. There are hordes of carriages, people on horseback, and even domestic animals running around. They are out of order and running in different directions.

3. Why did not Goya directly draw the scene of the war?

The war painted by Goya is a scene we do not often see in paintings. Most painters liked to draw pictures of battles, heroes and victories, but Goya described it from a different perspective. Wars are not caused by ordinary people. Many times they don't even know why conflicts occur, but wars come to them. What they know is almost the same as those of us standing in front of the painting. They can only flee for their lives.

4. Why did Goya choose to paint fictional creature?

The giant symbolizes war or its danger that makes people afraid. On the other hand, we can also think of giants as guarding humans or the horror that humans make people frantic. Therefore, this painting is also called "Panic". Goya uses this giant mystery-like creature to express indescribable thoughts and emotions.


## Impressionism

The Luncheon

Jean Monet

1873

1. Why the white areas in the painting seem to be particularly eye-catching?

Monet used a white tablecloth to concentrate the light, so although the sky was not drawn, the picture was full of sunlight. The female clothing in the background, although not so strong, has the same effect.
However, it is surprising that these parts that look white were painted in other colours. They are actually blue, pink and light purple. All the reflected light merges here, making it look like white.

2. Is this painting really painted in the yard?

Monet believes that painting should be done on the spot, and if he wants to paint the scenery of the yard, he paints in the yard. Before this, no matter what subject, painters usually painted in the workshop. Although painting in the workshop is very accessible, people can paint day and night, but the light in the workshop is very different from that of the outdoors. In order to paint the original appearance, Monet likes to paint in the place where things were originally located.

3. Why did Monet draw things so vaguely?

Because when we look at things, we only have a general impression. Like seeing a tree, we do not look at each leaf carefully but only look at the approximate shape and colour. Monet just wanted to show this effect. He did not draw a clear outline but faithfully draws what he "sees".

4. Why is Monet called Impressionist?

In fact, "impressionism" was just a joke at first. In 1874, Monet exhibited "Impression · Sunrise". Only fuzzy shapes could be seen in the painting, and the term "impressionism" was born from this. At that time, many people thought that Monet's work was terrible, and they felt that this must have been a failed work painted in a hurry - at that time, the word "impression" had a draft meaning. They didn't know that Monet changed the history of painting forever. Future painters pay attention to these subtle, delicate and impermanent "impressions".


## Post-Impressionism

Bedroom in Arles

Vincent van Gogh

1888

1. Whose room is it?

It is Van Gogh's room. He lived in a small town in Provence in the south of France when he painted this painting. Van Gogh drew this neatly packed room, which shows his determination to tidy up everything around him. Before painting this picture, he stayed in a hotel, having no fixed residence.

2. Are all his paintings on the wall?

Correct. Van Gogh was always painting, and his favourite thing to do is painting. Because he couldn't live in a room without painting, he hung his images on the wall as decoration. There are two portraits of his friends on the right wall, the next two are sketches, and the inside walls are decorated with landscape paintings. These show the various styles of Van Gogh.

3. Is the wall a bit crooked?

Yes, the walls are indeed not straight. This is because the bedroom is in the corner of the house and protrudes slightly. Another work, "The Yellow House", was painted by Van Gogh from the outside of the house, which can tell how much it protrudes.

4. Why did not he use many colours?

Van Gogh wanted to paint as vibrant and impressive paintings as possible, so he used a lot of contrasting colours. Such as orange, blue, green and red, and it felt like all the energy was concentrated in the painting.
He ignored the shadows that would reduce the strength of the picture, and the colour of the frame also plays a role. In order to balance with the vitality in the painting, Van Gogh often used pure white frames.


## Fauvism

![La danse](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74121985/115401836-ba95ea80-a1e2-11eb-84a5-d9b28dfdec94.jpg)

La danse

Henri Matisse

1909

1. Why people in this painting naked without genitalia?

When Shchukin commissioned Matisse to paint this work, he asked for the dancers to be dressed. Matisse’s choice to depict them in the nude proved to be scandalous when he exhibited it at the Autumn Salon in Paris. Some even went as far as accusing him of having a mental illness.
This situation strained their artist/patron relationship. Eventually the two reached an agreement saying that the dancers could be depicted naked but that no genitalia would be explicitly illustrated.

2. Do you agree that this artwork is rhythmic?

The massive painting measures 230 by 391 centimetres. However, even in these dimensions, the framework is too narrow for the size of the figures. In order for them to fully fit into the frame, Matisse had to put an arch in some of their backs.
Thus, the viewer’s gaze is drawn in by their circular characteristics: the figures on top are folded, in the act of arching their backs, while those on the bottom are extended. Their curves dominate the composition and by joining hands, their circular shape gives the painting a feeling of movement and motion.

3. Do Matisse prefer to use of symbolism in art?

Yes, Matisse created his painting during a period of artistic maturity. At the time of its execution, he was reaching the height of his use of symbolism in art. His compositions became more refined as the colours become more balanced.
The Dance was commissioned by the famous Russian collector, Sergei Shchukin. He asked for Matisse to create two paintings to hang in his home in Moscow. It was decided that the three underlying themes would be action, passion and contemplation.

4. How do you describe of five figures in the painting?

The individuals are entirely lost in their dance, oblivious to any daily obligations and work. Matisse does not focus on the dancers’ individual appearance, but rather on the movement and rhythm they create together. The dance is the ultimate symbol of the reconciliation of individuals.
The five figures are holding hands in a circle, but on the left, we can notice that the two individuals’ hands are parted; they only slightly brush instead of holding. However, Matisse carefully placed the rupture where it overlaps the other figure’s leg as not to break the colours and circle’s harmony. The rupture’s point being closest to the viewer’s position, it can be interpreted as an invitation to join in the dance. The circle comes to find those that “are outside,” and thus unify individuals.


## Expressionism
![The Scream](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74121985/115402080-fd57c280-a1e2-11eb-8238-a6f438c343aa.jpg)

The Scream

Edvard Munch

1893

1. What is this painting represent for?

According to Munch himself, The Scream was a picture he painted to represent his soul. Rather than adhering to the art style of the time — that is, painting pictures meticulously to realistically represent the subjects in them — he chose to use an unrealistic style to paint his emotions, rather than focus on realism and perfectionism in his art. Munch explained that he painted a moment of existential crisis. He was walking down a road similar to the one in the painting, while the sun was setting, creating a beautiful, vibrant background. His friends were walking with him, but, looking out at the sky in front of them, he stopped, while they continued walking. He then described having what we would now consider to be a panic attack; he suddenly became tired, anxious, claustrophobic, and the weight of nature and of the world hit him all at once.

2. Do you think this artwork is painted by who has mental problem?

After painting The Scream, Munch checked himself into a mental health hospital because he claimed he was hearing voices. The Scream was not the only byproduct of horrible anxiety and nonexistent mental health. Although it is arguably the most famous of Munch’s works, his other paintings focused around mental health as well. Some paintings were portraits of his dead sister. His piece titled Anxiety, painted after The Scream, looks eerily similar to the famous painting.

3. Why Munch use exaggerated colors?

Munch used color in this painting mostly to convey emotion and drama. He really pushed the colors in the direction of his idea, rather than to paint realistically.
There is a powerful contrast between exaggerated reds and oranges used for the sunset in the background, and the dull blues, greens, purples and grays used for everything else.
The use of color contrast in this painting works two ways: to show the intensity of the "blood red" sunset in the background and the drama of the ghoulish figure on the bridge. Both of these extremes need each other to work effectively in the painting; they complement each other like red complements green. The ghoulish figure was painted with sickly colors: dull yellows, blues, and purples. Dark and light accents painted over the top hint at the "screaming" expression of the figure. No attention was given by Munch to paint this figure with any sense of realism. It is likely this was a figure of Munch's own tormented mind.

4. Why this painting shows in a distorted forms?

Munch made use of swirling lines to create a sense of movement, much like Vincent van Gogh did in The Starry Night. Swirling lines were used for the surrounding nature and also the distorted figure. The bridge, the two other figures on the left-hand side and the distant boats in the water are painted with rigid lines and shapes. This may represent a contrast between nature and the civilization being forced upon it.
The two figures on the left-hand side are simple and abstract, but not really distorted like the main figure. This really alienates the main figure, which was painted with elongated hands, a curving body and primitive facial features.


## Cubism
![Les Demoiselles d'Avignon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74121985/115402175-16f90a00-a1e3-11eb-8f4f-1ff20f883d87.jpg)

Les Demoiselles d'Avignon

Pablo Picasso

1907

1. Why Picasso's artworks is unrealistic?

Picasso challenged conventional, realistic forms of art through the establishment of Cubism. He wanted to develop a new way of seeing that reflected the modern age, and Cubism is how he achieved this goal.
Picasso did not feel that art should copy nature. He felt no obligation to remain tied to the more traditional artistic techniques of perspective, modeling, and foreshortening and felt two-dimensional object. Picasso wanted to emphasize the difference between a painting and reality.Cubism involves different ways of seeing, or perceiving, the world around us.  Picasso believed in the concept of relativity – he took into account both his observations and his memories when creating a Cubist image. He felt that we do not see an object from one angle or perspective, but rather from many angles selected by sight and movement. As a result of this belief, Cubism became about how to see an object or figure rather than what the artist was looking at.

2. Is this painting break traditional perspective?

Yes, Les Demoiselles d’Avignon marks a radical break from traditional composition and perspective in painting. It depicts five naked women composed of flat, splintered planes whose faces were inspired by Iberian sculpture and African masks. The compressed space they inhabit appears to project forward in jagged shards, while a slice of melon in the still life at the bottom of the composition teeters on an upturned tabletop. Picasso unveiled the monumental painting in his Paris studio after months of revision. The Avignon of the work’s title is a reference to a street in Barcelona famed for its brothels.

3. What is the mask stand for?

The masks in the painting reflect Picasso's obsession with primitive art, not only of African origin but also the art of ancient Iberia, or modern-day Spain and Portugal. The simple forms, angular planes and bold shapes used in primitive art were instrumental in the artist's restructuring of artistic conventions. 

4. Did Picasso try to abandon Renaissance tradition of painting?

The planes of Les Demoiselles are flattened, abandoning the Renaissance tradition of painting in a three-dimensional style. Picasso shattered this illusion quite literally as the women appear jagged and broken. For example, the woman on the left of the painting has a left leg that appears to have been painted as if viewed from many angles. Because the planes of the artwork are flattened, it is almost impossible to distinguish her leg from the background, blending the figures in with the colors surrounding them. 
Picasso has painted these women in an arresting fashion. Standing at seven feet tall, they stare unflinchingly at the viewer, unashamed of their nakedness. Originally, Picasso had painted the woman on the left as a male medical student entering the brothel, but instead chose to portray only women in the artwork. It is suggested that by removing a male presence from the artwork, the viewer becomes the ‘customer’ of these women; they are not confined to paying attention to a male within the artwork.


## Dadaism and Surrealism
![The Persistence of Memory](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74121985/115402277-2e37f780-a1e3-11eb-9e74-bd59ebb95d6d.jpg)

The Persistence of Memory

Salvador Dalí

1931

1.what is Surrealism?

Poet André Breton French founded Surrealism in 1924 in opposition to the prevailing Enlightenment ideals that governed much of art and literature in the 17th and 18th centuries. Breton and the Surrealists were devoted followers of Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, and his psychoanalytic theory of personality gave the group of artists and writers a North Star for creative production. By accessing the unconscious mind—the collection of thoughts, memories, dreams, and urges not dictated by the conscious mind—these artists would engage in a pure form of artmaking that had not been sterilized by social mores or insecurities.

2. How Surrealists represent arts?

Surrealists looked to different methods to access the buried information that existed below the surface of their consciousness, but many adopted automatism, a means of making art that embraced chance and attempted to remove consciousness. By splattering paint, allowing materials to fall and be placed according to chance, and doodling around the resulting shapes and composition, the artist essentially removed their agency as much as possible from the creative process. This resulted in works like André Masson’s Battle of Fishes (1926), a multimedia piece in which randomly adhered sand becomes a mountain range and red splatters leak like blood from a fish’s mouth.
Other artists, like Dalí, looked to dreams for inspiration. Dreaming is a function of the unconscious mind, and Dalí took advantage of sleep to fuel his practice. He was known to take micro-naps throughout the day. These quick bursts of sleep provided both creative and physical benefits. Brief naps allowed Dalí to enter into a hyperassociative state—even if briefly—that made it easier to bring unexpected associations and concepts together.

3. Why clocks looks like melted?

It was the first appearance of the famous soft watches that will become one of Dalí ‘s most beloved symbols. Time melts, abandoning any claim to be an absolute reference, with some references to Albert Einstein’s new Relativity Theory, according to which time became a flexible, questionable coordinate. If time is no longer reliable in the real life, how meaningful can it be in the dreamlike dimension? The persistence of time is therefore relative: time is unstable and volatile, and our memory is probably the only way to provide durability and stability. At the same time, the concept of persistence becomes a hoax: the sensations given by the painting are everything but a sign of persistence and solidity.

4. Why the ants congregat?

The final important element of this painting is the cluster of ants gathering on the back of the only face-down pocket watch in the composition. Part of me wonders if this fourth watch with its coppery-orange metal was a later addition to the composition. Dali may have added it as a means of extra emphasis, perhaps—ants, of course, being those insects that arrive to carry away any crumb of sustenance and life they can find. When considered in light of the solitary fly (a harbinger of disease) found on the watch face above, these ants could easily be seen as agents of destruction.
With the fourth watch and ants included, Dali has created a sort of visual arrowhead—crafting a painting with a much more dynamic and non-traditional composition. The closeness of the fourth watch to the edge of the painting draws the eye, as does its more intense, orange, color and the contrasting black ants gathering on top of it.
There’s no reason to believe, for sure, that the fourth watch was added later—but its visual importance makes it clear that the ants (or their destructive influence, at least) hold special meaning to Dali.
