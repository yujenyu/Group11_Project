The Birth of Venus

Sandro Botticelli

1484-1486 

A. Why does not Venus wear clothes?

Because she was just born, the goddess Trois Graces next to her was about to help her dress. This is not the moment when ordinary people are born, but the birth of a goddess. According to legend, Venus was already an adult when he was born.

B. What kind of flower is the flower in the painting?

Next to Venus is a rose. Because roses are a symbol of love and beauty, roses are usually painted around Venus. As soon as Venus steps on the ground, roses will grow wherever she walks. Also, because it is spring, Botticelli painted cornflowers. The pattern on the goddess Trois Graces's robe is the evergreen crape myrte flowers, which symbolize eternal life.

C. Why are there almost no shadows in this painting?

In order to express Venus's beauty beyond ordinary people, bright and soft colours are used throughout the painting. Her complexion reminds people of pearls, and the whole person is radiant. This painting allows people to see that her radiance has changed the world. Although the right side of the screen is darker, it looks like Venus has driven the darkness away.

D. Why do the people in the painting seem to be "attached'' to the background?

This is because Botticelli deliberately emphasized the characters' outline, which makes people feel as if they can be cut along the contour. The body drawn with meticulous lines is like a prison that seals the soul. This concept comes from a relationship with the Medici family's close Neo-Platonists, which were very popular in Florence in the fifteenth century. Botticelli often stayed with these philosophers and was deeply influenced by their thoughts.

David with the Head of Goliath

Caravaggio

1607

A. Who is he? Why is there a head in his hand?

He is the David in the Bible with the Goliath's head of the giant he killed. The Bible says that David resisted the giants and the people he led, not allowing them to harm his countrymen. He defeated their leader, which was equivalent to conquering all the enemies. He was initially just a shepherd. King Saul wanted to give him a bronze helmet and armour, but he refused, and he went straight to the battlefield in this way. His weapons were only a slingshot and five stones, while the giant wears armour and a bronze helmet and holds a bronze war and a sword. In order to describe David's courage, the painter chose to paint the last scene of this story.

B. How could David defeat the giant?

Although it seemed that Goliath was taller and more robust, this was also the reason for his failure. For shepherds who were good at using slingshots, it was easy to aim at the target. Goliath didn't pay attention to this thin boy at all, but David moved fast and had wisdom. As a result, Goliath's vast and robust body harmed himself because of his poor reaction and made David's weaknesses an advantage. 

C. Why did Caravaggio painted this picture so dark?

The dark background can set off the characters and make the theme more obvious. Caravaggio often used such backdrops, landscapes or other props to focus on several key elements. In this way, the characters in the paintings are easier to be understood and more dramatic.

D. Why does Goliath's head seem to roll out of the painting?

David held his head and stretched it towards us. The black background contrasted with the bright shape, producing a three-dimensional visual effect. The sense of light in Caravaggio's painting is like a projector. The brilliant part became like a relief as if about to run out of it. This technique makes this scene more charming
and makes the viewer have a kind of illusion as if he can reach out his hand to touch the characters in the painting.

The Colossus

Francisco de Goya

1808-1812

A. Is the person in the sky a Greek god?

No, it is not. This painting is called "The Colossus", which means "giant". He is taller than a mountain and has powerful muscles. But the author did not give him a name and identity source.

B. Are the people on the ground fleeing for their lives?

Although there are many people, the distance is too far, so their movements can not be seen clearly. However, we can see that they are escaping. There are hordes of carriages, people on horseback, and even domestic animals running around. They are out of order and running in different directions.


C. Why did not Goya directly draw the scene of the war?

The war painted by Goya is a scene we don't often see in paintings. Most painters like to draw pictures of battles, heroes and victories, but Goya describes it from a different perspective. Wars are not caused by ordinary people. Many times they don't even know why conflicts occur, but wars come to them. What they know is almost the same as those of us standing in front of the painting. They can only flee for their lives.

D. Why did Goya choose to paint fictional creatures?

The giant symbolizes war or its danger that makes people afraid. On the other hand, we can also think of giants as guarding humans or the horror that humans make people frantic. Therefore, this painting is also called Panic. Goya uses this giant mystery-like creature to express indescribable thoughts and emotions.
