## Material for the Game: What's Wrong
### Renaissance
* Raffaello Sanzio
* [The School of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_of_Athens)

![](./school_of_athens.jpg)

"School of Athens" is a large mural that the Pope ordered Raphael to paint in the Vatican palace, depicting intellectuals and hero from the ancient Greeks to the Renaissance.
1. Each of the two statues represents ancient Greek and Roman deities associated with wisdom. The statue on the right is a Minerva is a goddess of wisdom, warfare, and justice and an incarnation of studies. The one in the left is Apollo, the god of reason and harmony, who presides over the arts and entertainment, such as poetry and music.
2. In the picture, there are many well-known heroic figures primarily in the age of ancient Greek. For instance, a man in the bottom right pointing at a diagram on the ground is Euclid, a Greek mathematician. A man on the bottom left writing a book is Pitágoras, a Greek philosopher who emphasized the role of math and music. A man in the middle left wearing a helmet and armor is Alexander the Great, a king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon.

### Baroque
* Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio
* [The Calling of St Matthew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Calling_of_St_Matthew_(Caravaggio))

"The Calling of St. Matthew" is the one of the master piece in Baroque art drawing a scene of "Gospel of Matthew" where St. Matthew is called by Jesus Christ.   
1. A man in right who is reaching out his right hand is Jesus. This is recognizable because he has a circle of halo on his head which is a traditional way of visually representing light from the body of a god. One of the remarkable aspects of this painting is that this backlighting is depicted only vaguely which is different from traditional religious arts which depict halo clearly. This shows Caravaggio's motivation for Realism.
2. Though there is still some dispute as to who is Matthew in this painting, according to an influential view, a man in the left leaning on the desk is Matthew. This argument is based on the fact that there're coins in front of the man and Matthew was a working as a tax collector at that time.

### Romanticism
* Eugène Delacroix
* [Liberty Leading the People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Leading_the_People)

"Liberty Leading the People" by Delacroix is about the French July Revolution in 1830.
1. A woman depicted in the center is an imaginary character representing liberty and a symbol of France named "Marianne". In this painting Marianne is wearing a cap (Phrygian cap) which slaves in ancient Greece wear when they became freed and The motif is a good illustration of the concept of the work, liberation.
2. A flag that Marianne is raising is the today's national flag of France and it is said to have originated from a symbol of French Revolution. There are some similar motifs in the painting which have that 3 colors. (e.g. a flag on the top left and a cloth of a woman in the center)

### Post-Impressionism
* Paul Gauguin
* [Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? (1898)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Do_We_Come_From%3F_What_Are_We%3F_Where_Are_We_Going%3F)

1. A sleeping baby on the right represents the beginning of life. An old woman on the left is approaching death. Together, the painting from right to left suggests the cycle of "birth-sin-death".
2. The figure in the center is placed in a "Garden of Eden motif"; she is picking fruits from a tree. Gauguin intended to represent this woman as sin, like the allegory of Eve.

### Fauvism
* Henri Matisse
* [Still Life with Aubergines](https://www.henrimatisse.org/still-life-with-aubergines.jsp)

![](./still-life-with-aubergines_cricle.png)

1. A mirror at the left, partly obscured at the bottom by a drawing portfolio, reflects these and other objects on the table in an inconsistent fashion. It is as if Matisse is stating that the artist's mirror image of nature in a painting may take certain licenses with reality in the interests of the picture itself.
2. Three aubergines are balanced precariously on a table whose red cloth carries an undulating white pattern that reinforces their tuberous shape.

### Expressionism
* Edvard Munch
* [The Scream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream)

1. The artist was walking along the road with two friends – the sun was setting – suddenly the sky turned blood red – he paused, feeling exhausted, and leaned on the fence – there was blood and tongues of fire above the blue-black fjord and the city – his friends walked on, and he stood there trembling with anxiety – and he sensed an infinite scream passing through nature.
