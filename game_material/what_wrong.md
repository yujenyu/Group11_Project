1. A sleeping baby on the right represents the beginning of life. An old woman on the left is approaching death. Together, the painting from right to left suggests the cycle of "birth-sin-death". 
2. The figure in the center is placed in a "Garden of Eden motif"; she is picking fruits from a tree. Gauguin intended to represent this woman as sin, like the allegory of Eve.

During the process of creating this painting, Gauguin experienced a number of difficult events in his personal life. He suffered from medical conditions, financial challenges, and the death of his daughter. He want to finish his last painting to conclude the grand culmination of his thoughts. Therefore, this work represents how the artist viewed the life.
