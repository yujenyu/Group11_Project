![](./the_calling_of_st.matthew.jpg)

"The Calling of St. Matthew" is the one of the master piece in Baroque art drawing a scene of "Gospel of Matthew" where St. Matthew is called by Jesus Christ.   

1.779.297.Though there is still some dispute as to who is Matthew in this painting, according to an influential view, a man in the left leaning on the desk is Matthew. This argument is based on the fact that there're coins in front of the man and Matthew was a working as a tax collector at that time.

2.1074.156.A man in right who is reaching out his right hand is Jesus. This is recognizable because he has a circle of halo on his head which is a traditional way of visually representing light from the body of a god. One of the remarkable aspects of this painting is that this backlighting is depicted only vaguely which is different from traditional religious arts which depict halo clearly. This shows Caravaggio's motivation for Realism.

* [Still Life with Aubergines](https://www.henrimatisse.org/still-life-with-aubergines.jsp)

![](./still-life-with-aubergines_cricle.png)

The title of this picture is a monumental understatement, and one wonders if the artist used it ironically. It is, in terms of accessories and devices, one of the most complete presentations of his ongoing fundamental theme, the conversion of the artist's own studio into the idyllic world of Joy of Life.

1.767.218.A mirror at the left, partly obscured at the bottom by a drawing portfolio, reflects these and other objects on the table in an inconsistent fashion. It is as if Matisse is stating that the artist's mirror image of nature in a painting may take certain licenses with reality in the interests of the picture itself.

2.910.293.Three aubergines are balanced precariously on a table whose red cloth carries an undulating white pattern that reinforces their tuberous shape.

### Dadaism and Surrealism
* THE PERSISTENCE OF MEMORY
  
The picture appears to show the harbour of Right in the dawn. The landscape is concise: the sea appears in the depths, with small rocky formations on the right.
