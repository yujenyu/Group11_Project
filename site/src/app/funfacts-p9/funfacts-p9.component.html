            <h1>1. Why Picasso's artworks is unrealistic?</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="description">
            <p>Picasso challenged conventional, realistic forms of art through the establishment of Cubism. He wanted to develop a new way of seeing that reflected the modern age, and Cubism is how he achieved this goal. Picasso did not feel that art should copy nature. He felt no obligation to remain tied to the more traditional artistic techniques of perspective, modeling, and foreshortening and felt two-dimensional object. Picasso wanted to emphasize the difference between a painting and reality.Cubism involves different ways of seeing, or perceiving, the world around us. Picasso believed in the concept of relativity â€“ he took into account both his observations and his memories when creating a Cubist image. He felt that we do not see an object from one angle or perspective, but rather from many angles selected by sight and movement. As a result of this belief, Cubism became about how to see an object or figure rather than what the artist was looking at.

            <h1>2. How could David defeat the giant?</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="description">
            <p>Although it seemed that Goliath was taller and more robust, this was also the reason for his failure. For shepherds who were good at using slingshots, it was easy to aim at the target. Goliath didn't pay attention to this thin boy at all, but David moved fast and had wisdom. As a result, Goliath's vast and robust body harmed himself because of his poor reaction and made David's weaknesses an advantage.    </p>

            <h1>3. Why did Caravaggio painted this picture so dark?</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="description">
            <p>The dark background can set off the characters and make the theme more obvious. Caravaggio often used such backdrops, landscapes or other props to focus on several key elements. In this way, the characters in the paintings are easier to be focused on and more dramatic.

            <h1>4. Why does Goliath's head seem to roll out of the painting?</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="description">
            <p>David held his head and stretched it towards us. The black background contrasted with the bright shape, producing a three-dimensional visual effect. The sense of light in Caravaggio's painting is like a projector. The brilliant part became like a sculpture as if about to run out of it. This technique makes this scene more charming and makes the viewers have a kind of illusion as if they can reach out their hands to touch the characters in the painting.
