### Meeting Objective

Paper prototyping.

Type of games, principles for critical thinking.

### Notes & decisions

Vote for the type of games and period of art history. We used [this file](https://github.com/yujenyu/Group11_Project/blob/master/Meetings/23.1TimelineOfWesternArtHistory.pdf) as a reference for defining different periods in art history.

Assign the works for each team member:
- Lauren: Renaissance, Baroque, Romanticism

## Week 5 (09/03/21, 13:00 - 13:30)

### Meeting Objective

Design thinking, Schema.

### Notes & decisions

We create [scope.md](https://github.com/yujenyu/Group11_Project/blob/master/scope.md) for sharing our studies on different periods in art history. Scope.md file will also be material for the timeline in our application. To achieve the educational purpose of our application, we want our users develop different levels of critical thinking through the games. By learning through art history, we hope users can have the following levels of critical thinking:
- Remembering
- Understanding
- Applying
- Analyzing
- Evaluating
- Creating

[Reference](https://github.com/yujenyu/Group11_Project/blob/master/Meetings/16.1CriticalThinkingThruArtHistActivities.pdf) of levels of critical thinking through art history activities.

We decided to design two games - quiz and spot differences. In the quiz, users can challenge themselves by answering interesting questions about the artists and masterpieces from different periods in art history. For spot differences, users will try to find differences between the original and modified versions of the paintings. Each difference between the painting has a significant meaning for the work itself. Users will learn how to look at and analyze paintings by playing this game.

### Next steps

Collect materials for quiz and find differences.



## Week 5 (11/03/21, 10:30 - 11:15)

### Meeting Objective

Documentation

### Agenda

Create a skeleton project report.

Turn paper prototype into a wireframe.

### Notes & decisions

Remove "Futurism" and "Pop Art" from the timeline.

### Next steps

Concentrate on the interaction flow around the system.



## Week 6 (18/03/21, 11:00 - 12:15)

### Meeting Objective

Set up everything before the feedback meeting

### Notes & decisions

Finish and discuss prototyping. We decided the fundamental layout of our application. The application will divide into four section: front page, timeline, quiz, and spot differences. Users can scroll the page to switch between different sections. Basically, our application will be a full page scrolling style. 

### Next steps

Photoshop the painting for "Art Detective", do descriptions and questions for "Fun Facts". 



## Week 7 (23/03/21, 13:00 - 13:45)

### Meeting Objective

Project prototyping.

Video of prototyping by Lauren.

### Agenda

Collect the feedbacks of the video

### Notes & decisions

Discuss the game type and how to implement it. We confirmed two games will be designed: “fun facts” and “art detective”. We changed the quiz to fun facts, which users can select the questions they are interested and learned the stories behind the questions. Art detective is a new name for spot differences. Users spot the differences by clicking the picture, system will tell how many number of differences left. 

### Next steps

Modify the prototype and implement the skeleton of the game.



## Week 7 (25/03/21, 10:15 - 11:10)
