History on Canvas is an art educational application. The application will make learning art history more interesting and fun. People from different times of history used art as a media to express their thought and creativity. Art also acts like a mirror that artists use to reflect society. We can find that some greatest movements in art were inspired by the society where they were existing. Learning art history makes us know our past and enhances aesthetic perspective. 

Our team focuses on the critical thinking that our users can leverage from the application. Based on this [reference](https://github.com/yujenyu/Group11_Project/blob/master/Meetings/16.1CriticalThinkingThruArtHistActivities.pdf), users can gain different levels of critical thinking through art history activities. It is the main aim that we want to build the games in our application that could cover those different levels. From low to high, there are six different levels we want to integrate in the application:
1. Remembering
1. Understanding
1. Applying
1. Analyzing
1. Evaluating
1. Creating

In History on Canvas, users will find brief introductions of different movements through the timeline. We summarised the movements which start from Reinancess to Abstract Expression and focus on the painting. Users can enjoy two interesting games: Fun Facts and Art Detective. Fun Facts will let users guess short stories behind the masterpieces. Art Detective will challenge users to spot the differences between original paintings and modification ones. You can watch our introduction video to preview the whole application.

The project objectives will be:
* Make a easy to use application, which users can learn about art history
* Design games that are interesting and educational
* Users can enhance different levels of critical thinking through our application
* The application can be easily extended, so developers could include more features and contents in the future
