The movement emphasized intense emotion as an authentic source of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as apprehension, horror and terror, and awe—especially that experienced in confronting the new aesthetic categories of the sublimity and beauty of nature.

### Fauvism
### Expressionism
Expressionism is an artistic movement which became popular in early 20 century's Germany and Austria. It does not refer to a particular style, but rather to a group of painters who avoided objective expression and focused instead on "expressing" their own invisible inner feelings, subjective awareness or perceived worldview.　Its orientation towards independence from objective shapes colours influenced later Surrealism and contemporary art.

### Cubism
Given the movement of Fauvism and Post-Impressionism (especially works of Cézanne), Cubism is an art style invented by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in early 20 century which is characterized as deconstruction of the common sense of art of representing the space since the Renaissance, decomposing the various surfaces of the object and reconstructing them on the canvas. It was called so because the works looked like a stack of cubes.

### Futurism
The most revolutionary of all modern art movements, Cubism was the creation of the artists Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Soon, more painters began to work in the style, and Cubism provided inspiration for related movements elsewhere – Futurism in Italy, Vorticism in Britain, Constructivism in Russia, and Precisionism in America. Futurism is officially launched when the Futurist Manifesto is published by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in Paris in February 1909. The Futurists celebrated the modern world, especially its machines and technology.

### Dadaism and Surrealism
Dada, a movement without governing principles, appeared around 1915 as a revolt against the civilization that had engulfed the world in war. The Dadaists sought to embody the absurd in their work on the basis that absurd art reﬂects an absurd society. Dada was short-lived though, and during the 1920s, its ideas were absorbed into Surrealism.

Surrealism concentrated less on random absurdity than Dada, and more on the fertility of the unconscious mind and its ability to forge a superior, or "sur", reality. In particular, the work of the Surrealists directly inﬂuenced the birth of Abstract Expressionism.

While Dada and Surrealism took absurdity to an extreme degree, artists have always experimented with reality to create work that is rich in imagination and fantasy.

### Abstract Expressionism
Abstract expressionism is a post–World War II art movement in American painting, developed in New York in the 1940s. With surrealisma as its important predecessor, it lays emphasis on spontaneous, automatic, or subconscious creation. Additionally, it has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic.
