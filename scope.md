### Dadaism and Surrealism
Dada, a movement without governing principles, appeared around 1915 as a revolt against the civilization that had engulfed the world in war. The Dadaists sought to embody the absurd in their work on the basis that absurd art reﬂects an absurd society. Dada was short-lived though, and during the 1920s, its ideas were absorbed into Surrealism. 

Surrealism concentrated less on random absurdity than Dada, and more on the fertility of the unconscious mind and its ability to forge a superior, or "sur", reality. In particular, the work of the Surrealists directly inﬂuenced the birth of Abstract Expressionism.

While Dada and Surrealism took absurdity to an extreme degree, artists have always experimented with reality to create work that is rich in imagination and fantasy.
