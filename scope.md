### Renaissance

### Baroque
The Baroque style used contrast, movement, exuberant detail, deep colour, grandeur and surprise to achieve a sense of awe. The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rom. By the 1730s, it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style, called rocaille or Rococo, which appeared in France and Central Europe until the mid to late 18th century.

### Romanticism
Romanticism was an artistic, literary, musical, and intellectual movement that originated in Europe towards the end of the 18th century, it was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature, preferring the medieval rather than the classical.
The movement emphasized intense emotion as an authentic source of aesthetic experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as apprehension, horror and terror, and awe—especially that experienced in confronting the new aesthetic categories of the sublimity and beauty of nature.

### Impressionism
Impressionism is a 19th-century art movement characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.

### Post-Impressionism
Post-Impressionism is an artistic practice appeared in 1880s which is affected by and intended to overcome a movement of Impressionism art. Though Post-Impressionism art can include many different style of art, their works have in common that they are not intend to express just visual impressions like impressionism works, but attempt to incorporate the artist's emotions or world view into the work.

### Fauvism
Fauvism is the style of les Fauves (French for "the wild beasts"), a group of early 20th-century modern artists whose works emphasized painterly qualities and strong color over the representational or realistic values retained by Impressionism. While Fauvism as a style began around 1904 and continued beyond 1910, the movement as such lasted only a few years, 1905–1908, and had three exhibitions. The leaders of the movement were André Derain and Henri Matisse. ([Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauvism))

### Expressionism
Expressionism is an artistic movement which became popular in early 20 century's Germany and Austria. It does not refer to a particular style, but rather to a group of painters who avoided objective expression and focused instead on "expressing" their own invisible inner feelings, subjective awareness or perceived worldview.　Its orientation towards independence from objective shapes colours influenced later Surrealism and contemporary art.

### Cubism
Given the movement of Fauvism and Post-Impressionism (especially works of Cézanne), Cubism is an art style invented by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in early 20 century which is characterized as deconstruction of the common sense of art of representing the space since the Renaissance, decomposing the various surfaces of the object and reconstructing them on the canvas. It was called so because the works looked like a stack of cubes.

### Futurism
The most revolutionary of all modern art movements, Cubism was the creation of the artists Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Soon, more painters began to work in the style, and Cubism provided inspiration for related movements elsewhere – Futurism in Italy, Vorticism in Britain, Constructivism in Russia, and Precisionism in America. Futurism is officially launched when the Futurist Manifesto is published by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in Paris in February 1909. The Futurists celebrated the modern world, especially its machines and technology.

### Dadaism and Surrealism
Dada, a movement without governing principles, appeared around 1915 as a revolt against the civilization that had engulfed the world in war. The Dadaists sought to embody the absurd in their work on the basis that absurd art reﬂects an absurd society. Dada was short-lived though, and during the 1920s, its ideas were absorbed into Surrealism.

Surrealism concentrated less on random absurdity than Dada, and more on the fertility of the unconscious mind and its ability to forge a superior, or "sur", reality. In particular, the work of the Surrealists directly inﬂuenced the birth of Abstract Expressionism.

While Dada and Surrealism took absurdity to an extreme degree, artists have always experimented with reality to create work that is rich in imagination and fantasy.

### Abstract Expressionism
Abstract expressionism is a post–World War II art movement in American painting, developed in New York in the 1940s. With surrealisma as its important predecessor, it lays emphasis on spontaneous, automatic, or subconscious creation. Additionally, it has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic.

### Pop Art
Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States during the mid- to late-1950s. The movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising, comic books and mundane mass-produced objects. One of its aims is to use images of popular (as opposed to elitist) culture in art, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any culture, most often through the use of irony. It is also associated with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques. In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from its known context, isolated, or combined with unrelated material ([Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_art))
